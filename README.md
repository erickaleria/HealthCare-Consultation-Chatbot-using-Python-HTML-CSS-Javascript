The project presented use artificial intelligence to create a medical chatbot that could provide some basic details about the disease before consulting a doctor.   
Text-to-text medical chatbots enable patients to talk about their medical problems and provide personalized diagnosis based on symptoms. The patient can then be transferred to a specialist. This sequence of things fundamentally saves the doctor's time. In turn, chatbots are always available to help people in need of medical assistance. In addition, the virtual assistant may be responsible for reminding users to take medication and monitoring the patient's health status.   
Generally, chatbots communicate with real people. Chatbots are used in applications such as ecommerce customer service, call centers and internet games. However, with a chatbot, one can communicate with a text or voice interface and get responses through artificial intelligence.   
Chatbots are programs designed to automatically involve with received messages. The chatbot can be programmed to respond same way to respond differently to messages containing certain keywords every time and even use machine learning to adapt its response to suit the situation. These chatbots connect with potential patients who visit the site, help them find experts, schedule appointments, and get them the right treatment.
